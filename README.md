The repository is for code written and tested but not finalized.
Most of the stuff is related to dynamics and calculus problems 
associated with the Math Methods class or Intro Programming class
for students at Louisiana Tech University.  Everything should work,
but I am making no claims of beauty or elegance in the programming!
